- [ ] store client config somewhere (file, db, redis, env var)
- [ ] better logging
- [ ] sentry ?
- [x] expose charon version in headers (version + sha)
- [x] root "/" page
- [ ] for now, we're forwarding client ID and client secret to oidc provider (more like a "on your own" mode). We may need to add a "paying" mode where we store those secrets on our side, and give a charon secret to consumer with ttl validity to add more security
- [ ] provider custom config based
